# Sudoku Game

A fun and interactive Sudoku puzzle game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows players to fill a 9x9 grid with the digits 1 to 9, ensuring that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all digits without repetition. The game features a hint system to help players when they get stuck.

## Features

- **Backtracking Algorithm**: The game uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle.
- **User Input**: Players can input numbers into the grid, and the system will validate their moves.
- **Hint Option**: Players can get a hint if they are stuck, but it costs them points.
- **Scoring System**: Players start with a score of 100 and lose points for incorrect moves or using hints.
- **Responsive UI**: The game grid is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Game Over & Congratulations**: When the game is complete or the score reaches 0, a message appears to indicate the result.
